## 1.1 欢迎来到深度学习工程师微专业

### 1.1.1 关于AI
* AI is the new Electricity
*  Electricity had once transformed
countless industries: transportation,
manufacturing, healthcare,
communications, and more
*  AI will now bring about an equally
big transformation.

### 1.1.1 What you’ll learn
Courses in this sequence (Specialization):
1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning(神经网络与深度学习)
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter
tuning, Regularization and Optimization(改善深层神经网络：超参数调试、正则化以及优化)
3. Structuring your Machine Learning project(结构化机器学习项目)
4. Convolutional Neural Networks(卷积神经网络)
5. Natural Language Processing: Building sequence models(序列模型)

## 1.2 什么是神经网络？

It is a powerful learning algorithm inspired by how the brain works.

### Example 1 – single neural network

Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market and you want to fit a function that will
predict their price. It is a linear regression problem because the price as a function of size is a continuous
output.
We know the prices can never be negative so we are creating a function called Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)which starts at zero.

### Example 2 – Multiple neural network

The price of a house can be affected by other features such as size, number of bedrooms, zip code and
wealth. The role of the neural network is to predicted the price and it will automatically generate the
hidden units. We only need to give the inputs x and the output y.

## 1.3 用神经网络进行监督学习

$x_4$

$\sum_{i=0}^N\int_{a}^{b}g(t,i)\text{d}t$
